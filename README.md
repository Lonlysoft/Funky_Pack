# FUNKY PACK #
this project is an personal project made for:
- Enhance my skills with frontend and game development
- Give my characters of the Funky Pack an interactive environment
- test my english skills
- put this thing on my portfolio might be good
- confirm the thesis that it's a media collection not static fetish art only

# what is it?
Funky Pack is a game inspired by farming simulators. We all have heard the story of a farming simulator before: <br>
"There's this guy whose life is not good in the city and then he goes to a farm." <br>
the only difference between a normal farming simulator and Funky Pack is that the guy here never goes to the farm. He needs to work on the city to then go to a farm to see his family. <br>
The game takes place in american city. A city that is a mix of my U.S. beliefs. <br>
the game follows a structure of a weekly schedule. Dynny builds that schedule based on his jobs.

Full schedule run
-
Dynny can do as many jobs he wants as long as they don't overlap much. with a full schedule there's a chance where the locations of each job are far away. To be fair play, the clock changes to a stopwatch 10 minutes early. As if it had a kind of slow motion effect.

stats
-
Dynny has stats like life, hunger, joy, stamina and solitude. <br>
the player needs to watch out for those 5.

life: it's mostly refered as HP. Dynny has 200 HP. if he reaches 0 HP. Game Over. you have 2 options. go to hospital that will append your debt, or reset game to the latest save. which is a reset. <br>
HUNGER: Dynny gotta eat. if he doesn't, he might faint and eat the holding object to satisfy his hunger. <br>
JOY: How dynny feels. Joy is given by spending time with nukko, playing games or doing leisure activities. <br>
solitude: a special bar that decreases by the years that you're away from Nukko. Dynny doesn't understand that, but Nukko is important to him. And not having him around for too long might get his life empty. if this bar goes to 0. objects like trees and stores might close and Dynny will notice a decrease in water levels.

Jobs
-
Dynny needs to work to pay his debt. the work is made via mini games. and at the end of the month you get his wage.
