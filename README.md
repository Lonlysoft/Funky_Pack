# FUNKY PACK #
this project is an personal project made for:
- Enhance my skills with frontend and game development
- Give my characters of the Funky Pack an interactive environment
- test my english skills
- put this thing on my portfolio might be good
- confirm the thesis that it's a media collection not static fetish art only

# what is it?
Funky Pack is a game inspired by farming simulators. We all have heard the story of a farming simulator before: <br>
"There's this guy whose life is not good in the city and then he goes to a farm." <br>
the only difference between a normal farming simulator and Funky Pack is that the guy here never goes to the farm. He needs to work on the city to then go to a farm to see his family. <br>
The game takes place in american city. A city that is a mix of my U.S. beliefs. <br>
the game follows a structure of a weekly schedule. Dynny builds that schedule based on his jobs.

Full schedule run
-
Dynny can do as many jobs he wants as long as they don't overlap much. with a full schedule there's a chance where the locations of each job are far away. To be fair play, the clock changes to a stopwatch 10 minutes early. As if it had a kind of slow motion effect.

stats
-
Dynny has stats like life, hunger, joy, stamina and solitude. <br>
the player needs to watch out for those 5.

life: it's mostly refered as HP. Dynny has 200 HP. if he reaches 0 HP. Game Over. you have 2 options. go to hospital that will append your debt, or reset game to the latest save. which is a reset. <br>
HUNGER: Dynny gotta eat. if he doesn't, he might faint and eat the holding object to satisfy his hunger. <br>
JOY: How dynny feels. Joy is given by spending time with nukko, playing games or doing leasure activities. <br>
solitude: a special bar that decreases by the years that you're away from Nukko. Dynny doesn't understand that, but Nukko is important to him. And not having him around for too long might get his life empty. if this bar goes to 0. objects like trees and stores might close and Dynny will notice a decrease in water levels.

# Dialogs

- Dynny: and that's that
well, accidents happen, but I actually told you that it was expensive...
I can pay your debt if you want.
No, I'm good. The thing is... what can I do to get all this money? Health is just for wealthy ones or what?
Well, guess you'll need to work.
debts aren't gonna pay by themselves, so You'll need to work to pay them all.
I saw some jobs in the newspaper so you can apply for some... or find some people that want your help. I heard that the pavan needs a guy to deliver the newspaper at 4am. if you want, I can call him.

thanks nukko.

new in town? this isn't new

I wanna know how lonely you can get if you don't have any families in here.
Well, you have nukko, so... you're not that alone.
my family is just off there because they're evading taxes. I'm just here because I like living here.
I don't need them because I have my maids and you.
I love you, Dynny...
don't get me wrong... I'm not gay, I like you platonically.

You'll continue receiving your salary. I'm rich. You won't be punished.

You'll be more than my driver. you'll be my member. in this world, dad always said that, you need to firm connections with others in order to grow. you don't need to like or chat with them like in a bar. just having his simple contact can give you power to do anything you wish.

I heard that if you know the right people they'll quit your debt.
It's not dignity if you work more than everyone, like I don't even work. You work about 4 different jobs and all just to pay off a debt from a thing that wasn't even that serious.

the crystal is beautiful.

I'm not here for anything, let's go Dynny.

my dad says that we cannot go to airport in debt. but he actually is referring that if anything you'll need a private jet.

the street of same houses? kinda gross, but unification is key.

is this your house? Looks small, but it may be pretty comfy.

dad always tells me that gross people lives in trailers, but Nukko is so cute I'm not sure that it's true.

Nukko eats you? can he eat me too?
wow Dynny, your friend's belly is so comfy. I could be here forever...

can I get eaten by you?
comfy as always. i could make you my sleep sack 

like what? saving the world? this isn't gonna happen, actually they don't care much about anything related to that. it's the 21st century and no one actually care if aliens are real or not.
I don't know why your family abandoned you, you're such a chill guy.


I know this guy!
